# Shining Soul 3

This is a hobby project created with Unreal Engine 4.19.2.

We plan to make  an ARPG game similar to Shining Soul 2.

## Coding Conventions

1. We only use blueprints as data containers so ideally all game logic should be put into C++.

2. List all the include files in alphaalphabetical order.

3. Public property first then protected then private.

4. Functions first then properties. 

## Development plan

### Version 1.0

1. A player has a weapon and can attack.

2. AI controlled enemies which can attack the player.
